This project takes an image, either locally, or remotaly, and displays it on an e-ink display.

This was writter on a Raspberry Pi Zero W 2, using Waveshare's 7.3 inch 7 color e-ink display.

This project pulls in Rob Weber's Omni-EPD, so it "should" work with most e-ink displays.

This project was inspired by several e-ink display project including:
pycasso - System to send AI generated art to an E-Paper display through a Raspberry PI unit.
PiArtFrame - EPD project that displays randomly generated fractal art.
